These directories contain information useful in acquiring and performing the
tests described in the manuscript.

Several utility programs are included:

 * `find_square.py`
 * `display_layout.py`



Scaling tests were performed on the largest square subset of tiles in the
datasets without any gaps. For each dataset this square had dimension NxN where
N was:
